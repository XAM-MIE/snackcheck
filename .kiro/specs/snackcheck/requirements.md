# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SnackCheck is a mobile-first application designed to help consumers make informed food choices by scanning food labels, decoding ingredients, and providing health scores. The app uses OCR technology to extract text from food labels, maps ingredients to the OpenFoodFacts database, and leverages AI to explain complex terms in plain English. The primary goal is to deliver a working MVP within 48 hours that can scan food labels and provide health insights within 5 seconds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: OCR Label Scanning

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to scan a food label with my smartphone camera so that I can quickly extract ingredient information without manual typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the camera interface THEN the system SHALL display a viewfinder for capturing food labels
2. WHEN a user captures a photo of a food label THEN the system SHALL process the image using OCR technology
3. WHEN OCR processing is complete THEN the system SHALL extract text with at least 80% accuracy on readable labels
4. IF the OCR fails to extract readable text THEN the system SHALL provide fallback demo images for testing
5. WHEN text extraction is successful THEN the system SHALL identify and parse ingredient lists from the extracted text

### Requirement 2: Ingredient Lookup and Mapping

**User Story:** As a health-conscious person, I want ingredient information mapped to a reliable database so that I can get accurate nutritional and health data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ingredients are extracted from a label THEN the system SHALL query the OpenFoodFacts API for each ingredient
2. WHEN an ingredient is found in OpenFoodFacts THEN the system SHALL retrieve nutritional and health information
3. IF an ingredient is not found in OpenFoodFacts THEN the system SHALL flag it for AI explanation
4. WHEN API queries are complete THEN the system SHALL compile ingredient data for health scoring
5. IF the OpenFoodFacts API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use cached data for the top 50 common ingredients

### Requirement 3: AI Ingredient Decoding

**User Story:** As a parent, I want plain-English explanations of food additives and complex ingredients so that I can understand what my family is consuming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an ingredient is not found in OpenFoodFacts THEN the system SHALL query an AI service for explanation
2. WHEN AI processing is requested THEN the system SHALL provide plain-English explanations of ingredient purposes and effects
3. WHEN AI explanations are generated THEN the system SHALL present them in user-friendly language
4. IF AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a generic "unknown ingredient" message
5. WHEN explanations are complete THEN the system SHALL include them in the final health assessment

### Requirement 4: Health Score Calculation and Display

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to receive a quick, color-coded health score so that I can make informed purchasing decisions within seconds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all ingredient data is collected THEN the system SHALL calculate an overall health score
2. WHEN health score is calculated THEN the system SHALL assign a color code (ðŸŸ¢ Green for healthy, ðŸŸ¡ Yellow for moderate, ðŸ”´ Red for unhealthy)
3. WHEN the health score is ready THEN the system SHALL display results within 5 seconds of scan initiation
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show the color-coded score prominently
5. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a breakdown of contributing factors

### Requirement 5: Mobile-First User Interface

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want an intuitive interface that works seamlessly on my smartphone so that I can scan products while shopping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized interface
2. WHEN using the camera THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual guidance for label positioning
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL use a clean, readable layout optimized for mobile screens
4. WHEN navigating the app THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions between scan, processing, and results screens
5. WHEN the app is used offline THEN the system SHALL cache common ingredients for basic functionality

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a reliable demo that consistently works so that I can properly evaluate the solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning a food label THEN the system SHALL complete the scan-to-result process in 5 seconds or less
2. WHEN processing multiple scans THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance
3. WHEN demonstrating the app THEN the system SHALL have fallback demo assets available if live scanning fails
4. WHEN the app encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN running on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL function smoothly without crashes or freezing
